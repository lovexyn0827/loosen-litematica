Make block state checking in Litematica looser, by allowing alternatives blocks states in the same groups.

For example, you can use stone when the Litematica requires you to use quartz blocks, or use ordinal glass blocks when stained glass blocks are required.

Generally, blocks other than redstone components and rails has alternatives available, and all such blocks with identical properties (excluding materials, hardness, etc.) are in the same blocks. Further customization may be introduced in later releases.

The feature can be toggled by pressing F3 + O.

Of course, Litematica is required to use this Mod.
